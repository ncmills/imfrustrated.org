 * Cross-site footer links — LEGAL / SELF-HELP CLUSTER (funnel).

 * priority site only. Cluster priority: aissdi > idonthaveawill > doppelwriter > imfrustrated.
 * This site (imfrustrated, priority 4) links ONLY to sites above it → aissdi,
 * idonthaveawill, doppelwriter (all three). Nick reconfirmed the one-way funnel
 * on 2026-08-18: it is deliberate, and it stays. Never add a Planning-cluster or
 * Peptide-cluster site here, and never a personal site.
